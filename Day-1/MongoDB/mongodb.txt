NoSQL 
    It stands for Not Only SQL or No SQL
    It dont have any structural for database

Types of NoSQL Databases
    1. Document
        MongoDB, CouchDB, CosmosDB
    2. Key-Value
        Redis, DynamoDB
    3. Wide-Column
        Cassandra, HBase
    4. Graph
        Neo4j

Vertically Scalable vs Horizontally Scalable
    Vertical Scaling means, scale by ading more power (RAM, HDD, CPU, etc. ) to an exiting machine
    Horizontal Scaling means, scale by adding more machines into our pool of resources


MongoDB:
    - MongoDB is a  NoSQL Database
    - It is also called as Document oriented database
    - it is built or wirtten in C++
    - for web and mobile application development, use mongodb nosql database
    - it stores data in json-like document

JSON:
    JavaScript Object Notation
    let user  = {
        "name": "Mahesh Bodhgire",
        "address": "Pune",
        "contact": 7507406161,
        "email": "maheshbodhgire@ecorie.in"
    }

    *MongoDB stores data in BSON format, not exactly JSON format
        BSON - Binary JSON

Setup / Installation:
    visit - https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
    download and install the respective setup file for your system.
    
Start with MongoDB:
    1. Start MongoDB Server - mongod
    2. Connet with mongodb server with mongodb client - mongo

    *with mongo command - we can start with mognodb shell

MongoDB Shell:
    - MognoDB Shell is based on JavaScript
    - It supports ES6 (Advance JS)

    It comes with JavaScript Engine (Converting JS code into Machine code)
    to check JavaScript Engine enter the command
        iterpreterVersion();

Terminology:
    MySQL           MongoDB
    database        database
    table           collection
    record/row      document
    col/field       field
    indexing        indexing
    aggregation     aggregation

Data Type (BSON Types):
    1. string       ""
    2. Integer      NumberInt() / NumberLong()
    3. Array        []
    4. Boolean      true / false
    5. Double       0.0
    6. Object       {}
    7. Date         ISODate()
    8. ObjectID     ObjectId()

_id: 
    Mandatory field 
    it can create manually
    by default it been creted automatically

ObjectId:
    this is a default value for the _id;
    ObjectI is a 12-Bytes in size

    the first four bytes - timestamp
    the next three bytes -machine identifier
    the next two bytes - process id
    the last three bytes - counter
